                <p>Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In laymans terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. Pound is tic-tac-toe right? We have unlimited juice? This party is going to be off the hook.</p>

                <h2><span>Coding</span></h2>
                <p>I think there’s a world market for about 5 computers. (Thomas J. Watson, Chairman of the Board, IBM, circa 1948) Deleted code is debugged code. (Jeff Sickel) Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are–by definition–not smart enough to debug it.

                <p>There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation many never come again. But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?</p>
